# DESTROY THEM ALL! 

A WORLD WAR HAS STARTED, WHAT SIDE WILL YOU CHOOSE? THE AXIS POWERS, THE SOCIALIST BROTHERHOOD OR THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS? GRIDLOCKED WITHIN A WORLDWIDE CONFLICT, NATO FIGHTS FOR THEIR VALOR, THE AXIS FIGHTS WITH THEIR ACUITY AND THE BROTHERHOOD FIGHTS WITH THEIR VERITY.

ARE YOU READY TO PICK A SIDE?

Mod is still in progress until 1.0, PvP/standalone fighting capabilities aren't yet possible so test in sandbox. Units' stats aren't in finalized forms so take that into consideration as well

This mod is planned to include 12 nations and currently has 3 technically implemented nations so far: French, German and Soviet.
